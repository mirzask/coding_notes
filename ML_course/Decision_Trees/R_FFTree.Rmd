```{r}
library(FFTrees)
library(dataPreparation)
library(caTools)
```


```{r}
cardiac <- data.table::fread("Decision_Trees/mlbootcamp5_train.csv")
cardiac$age <- round(cardiac$age / 365, 0)
head(cardiac)
```

Create training and test sets:

```{r}
sample = sample.split(cardiac$cardio, SplitRatio = 0.7)

train = subset(cardiac, sample == TRUE)
test = subset(cardiac, sample == FALSE)
```

There is a nice tutorial on the `dataPreparation` package for data cleaning/processing [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataPreparation/vignettes/train_test_prep.html)



```{r}
cards_fft <- FFTrees(formula = cardio ~ .,
                     data = train,
                     data.test = test)
```


```{r}
plot(cards_fft, data = "test", decision.labels = c("Disease", "Healthy"))
```
